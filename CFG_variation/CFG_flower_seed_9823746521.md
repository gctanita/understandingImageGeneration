CFG variation - part 7
Images have been generated with seed 9823746521, and prompt **A beautiful flower,  Ultrarealistic, hyper realistic, 8k, high definition**

Number of steps: 20
Sampler: ddim
Width: 512
Height: 512


Here all the flowers from CFG 1 to CFG 10 are pretty realistic and well made. The flower from CFG 14 has 2 flower stems, and looks 3d computer generated. If I were to nick pick i find the center of all the flowers a bit wierd, excepting for CFG 1 wich doesn't seem to have another flowwer in it's center.
