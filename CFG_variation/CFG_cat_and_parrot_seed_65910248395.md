CFG variation - part 6
Images have been generated with seed 65910248395, and prompt **A blue fischer parrot dancing on top of a cat's head. Exactly 4 monarch butterfilies flying around the parrot. In front of the cat there are 5 balls, with planet patterns. The balls are in a puddle. Ultrarealistic, hyper realistic, 8k, high definition**

In this set of pictures... uff.. there are so many things wrong... the parrot is not anatomically correct in all of them not to mention that the breed is wrong. The cat's face becomes distorted starting with CFG 8. The number of balls from CFG 1 to CFG 3 is incorrect. The butterflies are chopped from CFG 8 upwards. From CFG 8 upwards the amount of contrast applied increases and gets out of control. Unfortunatley all the images generated on this seed are unusable.
