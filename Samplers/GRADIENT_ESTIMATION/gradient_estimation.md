GRADIENT_ESTIMATION is an experimental sampler in the diffusion ecosystem, likely designed to approximate gradients of the noise function more directly — potentially to speed up sampling or improve numerical stability during image generation. It’s not part of the traditional sampler families (like Euler, DPM++, or DDIM), and as of now, there is limited public documentation on it. It typically appears in ComfyUI, custom builds, or developer test branches, often for research or advanced use.


About:
- Probably deterministic (dependcs on implementation)
- Faster than multistep DPM samplers (theoretical)
- Output quality varies and may lack fine texture or lighting stability
- Good for testing, research, or rough preview generation


✅ Pros
- Fast generation, fewer steps required
- Interesting behavior for prompt variation or testing
- Could be used for score matching, faster latent traversal, or interactive use cases

⚠️ Cons
- Not well-documented — implementation-dependent
- May suffer from lack of sharpness, washed-out textures, or mode collapse
- Could behave unpredictably at high CFG values or low steps

For each image I gave it a score based on some on a set of subjective criteria designed to assess visual quality and consistency across different samplers. Each anomaly observed in the generated images deducted points from the total score, resulting in a binary scale (1 = acceptable, 0 = flawed). And for each image I recorded how much it took to generate them. Average normalized time means that I have eliminated the biggest 4 times from the series, that contained the loading of the model and / or parsing of the prompt for the first time.
