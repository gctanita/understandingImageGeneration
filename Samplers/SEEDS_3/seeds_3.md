Like SEEDS_2, the SEEDS_3 sampler is not part of the official Stable Diffusion or Hugging Face Diffusers library. It appears to be an experimental or custom sampler found in advanced tools like ComfyUI, InvokeAI, or internal forks.
Most likely, SEEDS_3 is part of a "multi-seed sampling framework", where the model:
- Generates an image using three seeds in parallel
- Blends or interpolates their latent noise representations
- Produces a hybrid image with properties from all three seed variants


About:
- it is not deterministic
- creative variation is very high
- best used for prompt fusion, seed morphing, ideation
- recommended steps 20–30 likely optimal
- CFG range likely works best at 6–12


𝙋𝙞𝙘𝙩𝙪𝙧𝙚 𝙜𝙚𝙣𝙚𝙧𝙖𝙩𝙞𝙤𝙣 𝙨𝙚𝙩𝙩𝙞𝙣𝙜𝙨:
- 4 prompts (you can find them here: https://github.com/gctanita/understandingImageGeneration/blob/master/experimentPrompts.md )
- Each prompt was generated 8 times with different seeds (each seed was used across each prompt)

For each image I gave it a score based on some on a set of subjective criteria designed to assess visual quality and consistency across different samplers. Each anomaly observed in the generated images deducted points from the total score, resulting in a binary scale (1 = acceptable, 0 = flawed). And for each image I recorded how much it took to generate them. Average normalized time means that I have eliminated the biggest 4 times from the series, that contained the loading of the model and / or parsing of the prompt for the first time.
