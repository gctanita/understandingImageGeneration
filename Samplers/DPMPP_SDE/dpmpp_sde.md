For each image I gave it a score based on some on a set of subjective criteria designed to assess visual quality and consistency across different samplers. Each anomaly observed in the generated images deducted points from the total score, resulting in a binary scale (1 = acceptable, 0 = flawed). And for each image I recorded how much it took to generate them. Average normalized time means that I have eliminated the biggest 4 times from the series, that contained the loading of the model and / or parsing of the prompt for the first time.
