DPM_FAST is a fast, simplified version of DPM (Denoising Probabilistic Models) samplers designed for quick image generation while still preserving decent quality. It's an experimental, speed-optimized sampler — ideal when you want quick previews or fast iteration, not necessarily the highest-fidelity output.

Technical Summary
- Goal: Reduce compute time by simplifying the sampling process.
- Likely uses aggressive step sizes and simplified noise schedules.
- Trades off some fine detail and stability in exchange for speed.
- May be based on first-order ODE solvers with fewer refinements than DPM++ or adaptive samplers.

Note: DPM_FAST is not a widely documented academic sampler — it's often specific to implementations like ComfyUI, InvokeAI, or custom forks of Stable Diffusion tooling.


✅ Pros
- Super fast generation
- Great for low-resource setups (e.g. older GPUs, mobile inference)
- Perfect for prompt prototyping or UI previews

⚠️ Cons
- Lower quality than DPM++, Euler, or Heun samplers
- May introduce blurriness, lack of detail, or poor lighting
- Not recommended for final renders or production-quality images

For each image I gave it a score based on some on a set of subjective criteria designed to assess visual quality and consistency across different samplers. Each anomaly observed in the generated images deducted points from the total score, resulting in a binary scale (1 = acceptable, 0 = flawed). And for each image I recorded how much it took to generate them. Average normalized time means that I have eliminated the biggest 4 times from the series, that contained the loading of the model and / or parsing of the prompt for the first time.
