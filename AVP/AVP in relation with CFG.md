# APV in relation with CFG

A while back I had discovered that APV (Average Patch Variance) was an easy and algorithmic way to distinguish between most pictures generated by AI and human made. I ran the APV algorithm on the Ballerina picture series, and was shocked to find out that APV grew in relation with CFG: the greater the CFG parameter the bigger the value of APV. 

Is it something specific for Qwen Image or something general? 
Right now, I know for sure this is something that replicates for Qwen Image model. For the rest? I'm planning to find out by doing the same experiments for other models.

Stay tuned :)
