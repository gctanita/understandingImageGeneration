# APV in relation with Steps

A while back I had discovered that APV (Average Patch Variance) was an easy and algorithmic way to distinguish between most pictures generated by AI and human made. I ran the APV algorithm on the Ballerina picture series, and discovered that the APV stays almost the same irellevant of the number of steps increase. I would have expected for the APV to have an evident increase or decrease as the number of steps. However the numbers tell another story.
